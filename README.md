# kevlar

---::[Reference-free variant discovery in large genomes]::---

Currently, kevlar development is focused almost entirely on finding novel variants in family-based trio and quad experimental designs.
However, the method lends itself easily to more general experimental designs, which will get more attention and support in the near future.

Although a reference genome is not required, it can be utilized to reduce data volume at an early stage in the workflow and reduce the computational demands of subsequent steps.

## Quick start

Coming soon!
