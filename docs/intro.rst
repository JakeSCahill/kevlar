Introduction to **kevlar**
==========================

The **kevlar** software is a testbed for developing reference-free variant discovery methods for genomics.
The initial focus of development is novel germline variant discovery in human trio / quad experimental designs.
However, the method lends itself easily to more general experimental designs, which will get more attention and support in the near future.

Although a reference genome is not required, it can be utilized to reduce data volume at an early stage in the workflow and reduce the computational demands of subsequent steps.

**kevlar** is currently under heavy development and is not yet stable.
That said, the core features of the software are reasonbly well tested, and leverage software components from `the khmer library <https://khmer.readthedocs.io>`_ which are very well tested.
