Command-line interface
======================

The **kevlar** command-line interface is designed around a single command :code:`kevlar`.
From this one command, a variety of tasks and procedures can be invoked using several *subcommands*.

Once **kevlar** is installed, available subcommands can be listed by executing :code:`kevlar -h`.
To see instructions for running a specific subcommand, execute :code:`kevlar <subcommand> -h` (of course replacing :code:`subcommand` with the actual name of the subcommand).

More information will be posted here soon!
